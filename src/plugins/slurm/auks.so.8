.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.LP
\fBauks.so\fR is a SLURM spank plugin that adds Kerberos credential support 
to SLURM using \fBAUKS API\fR. This plugin is enabled using the SLURM SPANK 
configuration file \fB/etc/slurm/plugstack.conf\fR according to the syntax 
mentionned in the previous synopsis.

.LP
\fBauks.so\fR SPANK plugin adds a \fB--auks\fR options to SLURM 
command line clients \fBsrun\fB, \fBsalloc\fR and \fBsbatch\fR.
This mechanism can alternatively be activated setting the \fBSLURM_SPANK_AUKS\fR 
environment variable to \fByes\fR.

.LP
Using \fBauks.so\fR, SLURM \fBclient commands\fR forwards the user kerberos 
credential to the \fBAUKS\fR daemon and set \fBSLURM_SPANK_AUKS\fR to \fBdone\fR 
prior to execute, allocate or submit.

.LP
\fBslurmstepd\fR, SLURM execution daemon, loading \fBauks.so\fR, checks that 
\fBSLURM_SPANK_AUKS\fR is set to \fBdone\fR and get user's credential using 
\fBAUKS API\fR.
To perform this get operation, \fBslurmstepd\fR user, i.e. \fBroot\fR, must have 
a valid kerberos credential in its environment. This can be enforced using 
\fBaukspriv\fR.
The \fBhostcredcache=\fR option can be used to specify a particular credential
cache file to be used instead of the default one (either the content of
\fBKRB5CCNAME\fB or /tmp/krb5cc_0 in case this EV is not defined).
The credential must also correspond to a principal associated 
with the \fBAUKS admin role\fR in the \fBauksd\fR ACL file \fBauks.acl\fR.

.LP
\fBslurmstepd\fR, during SPANK temporary privileges drop, launches a credential
renewer that is killed at the end of the step, prior credential removal.
Renewal is attempted as long as the credential is valid, first using \fBAUKS\fR 
daemons (requires that user principal is associated to \fBAUKS user role\fR), then 
using \fBKerberos KDC(s)\fR if an error occured.

.LP
\fBKRB5CCNAME\fR environment variable is set in job step environment according to 
the fetched credential enabling the user to access kerberized resources during 
execution.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
.TP
\fBconf=file.conf\fR
use file.conf as the configuration file for AUKS API
.LP
.TP
\fBdefault=disabled|enabled\fR
when set to \fBenabled\fR, the plugin is active unless users explicitly 
ask not to use it. The default is \fBdisabled\fR.
.LP
.TP
\fBspankstackcred=no|yes\fR
when set to \fByes\fR, \fBKRB5CCNAME\fR is set in the spank plugins stack
environment too, thus allowing next spank plugins to leverage its usage.
The default is \fBno\fR.
.LP
.TP
\fBminimum_uid=uid\fR
when set to a valid user numerical identifier \fBuid\fR, the plugin is not
active for user having a numerical identifier lower than that value.
The default is \fB0\fR, which allows every user on the system to use auks.
.LP
.TP
\fBhostcredcache=FILE:uri\fR
When set to a valid KRB5CCNAME entry, the privileged slurmstepd sections of
the plugin will use the content of this credential cache to secure auks
admin requests.
.LP
.TP
\fBsync=mode\fR
when set to \fByes\fR or \fBall\fR, automatically sync file systems before
stopping ticket renewer and/or removing the kerberos credential.
With kerberized file systems, this can prevent from losing data in case 
dirty pages flush is deferred to a moment when no valid ticket for the user
can be found on the system.
Note that this can cause performance degradation and delay the termination of
the step. The default mode is \fBno\fR to disable the feature. Available modes
are \fByes\fR|\fBall\fR to flush every FS using sync().
.LP
.TP
\fBenforced\fR
when set, consider that a missing credential at submission will be treated
as an error by the Spank stack. Spank plugins being able to be configured
as optional or required, set internal auks status to \fBdone\fR  in order
to allow slurmstepds to acquire a previously pushed credential if it exists
and the mode is optional. When not set, auks will silently disable auks if
no credential cache is available at submission time.
.br
To sum up :
.br
- if not set : transparently disable auks if no credential cache found
.br
- if set and this plugin is optional : enable auks, a previously credential
might be available
.br
- if set and this plugin is required : abort submission
.LP
.TP
\fBforce_file_ccache\fR
when set, force the retrieved credential to be stored in a file credential cache
of the form '/tmp/krb5cc_%uid%_%jobid%_XXXXXX'. This is the legacy storage behavior
of auks prior to version 0.5.0.
When no set, use the new default storage logic using the ccache type defined in krb5.conf
(mandatory when use keyring or KCM caches, especially useful with polyinstanciated
temporary directories).
.LP
.TP
\fBno_cc_switch\fR
The new default storage logic for credential force the selection of the freshly stored
credential as the new default one for the associated type using the krb5_cc_switch call.
This behavior might introduce strange behaviors in case multiple concurrent jobs are
started on a same node for a same user. This option disables this switch logic.
